This code is base on the challenge set forwards to simulate via die rolls the process of escaping a graveler softlock.
the process includes rolling four die with four sides and getting all ones, in order to in-theory escape this softlock 177 consecutive sucessful rolls of the die, the test case preformed 1e9 interations over various days. and 1e6 in 5 minutes. These tests yeilded a max of 99.
